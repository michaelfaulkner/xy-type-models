# Note on Cram√©r-von Mises configuration files

Note that each configuration file whose name is suffixed with a letter is a Markov-process configuration file, where 
the configuration file with no suffix must be used for the sample analysis.  For example, `128x128_ecmc_a.txt`, 
`128x128_ecmc_b.txt`, `128x128_ecmc_c.txt`, `128x128_ecmc_d.txt` and `128x128_ecmc_e.txt` are the five Markov-process 
configuration files that generate the samples for `128x128_ecmc.txt`.  This allows us to submit four separate 
Markov-process jobs to the cluster, thus optimising simulation time and ensuring larger system sizes fall within the 
time limit.
