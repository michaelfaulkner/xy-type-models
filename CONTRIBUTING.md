## Pull requests

We would be happy to receive your fixes and extensions and are looking forward to your pull requests! After a 
successful review of your code, we will merge your code into the main branch and add your name to [AUTHORS.md](
AUTHORS.md). In addition, your name will appear in the commit history of the repository.

For successful pull requests make sure you follow the following points:
- Follow the coding style described below.
- Test your code using the convergence tests as described in the [README.md](README.md) file.

## Coding style

In this project, we follow the [Fortran 90](https://www.fortran90.org/src/best-practices.html#fortran-style-guide) and 
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guides, with line-length limits set to 120 characters. Indent 
your code with 4 spaces per level.

The code must be compatible with Fortran 90 and any Python version >= 3.6.

We will be happy to assist contributors with their first few pull requests.
